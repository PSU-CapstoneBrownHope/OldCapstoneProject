# BRF Front-End Guide

This document is to define the practices used for developing the Front-End.
##Why Yarn?

1.

Using npm for a brief stint for me has been tedious because when installing an npm package - it installs it to the package.json and you have to explicitly declare you’re using it for the project by adding --save-dev as a parameter.

npm i typescript --save-dev
yarn add typescript

2. better dependency resolution

##Styled Components
https://styled-components.com/

Styling that is built for React components. Much cleaner than having CSS files everywhere + better features as well.

##Folder Structure
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/best-file-structure-for-react-components/

If the util is specific to the component - have a util file in the same folder, else they should be in the util folder in the src directory.

##Testing
Use react-testing and jest
https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/
https://jestjs.io/

Have a test for each main component. The test file should be within the same folder.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
